# Introduction of Basic Components


## Input Field [Email,Password]

The `Input` component is used to collect user input, particularly for text or email. It is commonly used in forms for various purposes, such as collecting user information.

## Example

<input
  style={{
    padding: "0.5rem",
    marginTop: "2rem",
    borderRadius: "0.5rem",
    border: "1px solid #ccc",
  }}
  type="email"
  name="email"
  placeholder="Email"
/>
<br />
<input
  style={{
    padding: "0.5rem",
    marginTop: "2rem",
    borderRadius: "0.5rem",
    border: "1px solid #ccc",
  }}
  type="Password"
  name="Password"
  placeholder="Password"
/>

## Props

- `type` (string, optional): Specifies the type of input, such as "text" or "email".
- `name` (string, optional): Provides a name for the input, which can be used in form handling.
- `placeholder` (string, optional): Displays a placeholder text when the input is empty.
- `value` (string, optional): Sets the initial value of the input.
- `onChange` (function, optional): A callback function that is called when the input value changes.

## Usage

You can use the `Input` component in your React application as follows:

```jsx
import Input from "your-input-library";

function MyForm() {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState(""); //states

  const handleEmailChange = (e) => {
    setEmail(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <Input
      type="email"
      name="email"
      placeholder="Enter your email"
      value={email}
      onChange={handleEmailChange}
      style={{
        marginRight: spacing + "em",
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

```jsx
import Input from "your-input-library";

function MyForm() {
  const [password, setPassword] = useState(""); //states

  const handlePasswordChange = (e) => {
    setEmail(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <Input
      type="password"
      name="password"
      placeholder="Enter Password"
      value={password}
      onChange={handlePasswordChange}
      style={{
        marginRight: spacing + "em",
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

# All about the States

In React, you can use states to manage dynamic data within a component. States are like JavaScript objects that help you keep track of changing values.

For example:

```jsx
const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
const [password, setPassword] = useState("");
```

# React Event Handler Functions

In React, event handler functions are used to respond to user interactions. They typically receive an event object as a parameter, allowing you to access information about the event, such as user input.

Here's an example:

```jsx
const handlePasswordChange = (e) => {
  setEmail(e.target.value);
};
```

React provides a variety of event listeners that allow you to respond to user interactions. Event listeners are attached to specific DOM elements and trigger associated event handler functions when particular events occur. Here are some common event listeners in React and how they are used:

## `onClick`

The `onClick` event listener is used to respond to user clicks on an element, such as a button. When the element is clicked, the associated event handler function is executed. Example:

```jsx
<button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Click Me</button>
```

## `onChange`

The `onChange` event listener is primarily associated with input elements, like text fields or checkboxes. It's used to capture changes in the input element's value, such as when a user types text or selects options.

```jsx
<input type="text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleInputChange} />
```

## `onSubmit`

The onSubmit event listener is used with HTML `<form>` elements to manage form submissions. It's triggered when the user submits the form, often by pressing "Enter" or clicking a submit button.

```jsx
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  {/* Form inputs */}
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
>
```

## Button

In web development, a button is an interactive element that users can click or tap to trigger a specific action or function. Buttons are an essential part of user interfaces, providing a clear and intuitive way for users to perform actions like submitting forms, navigating between pages, or initiating processes.

Buttons can be customized with different styles, colors, and sizes to match the overall design of a web application. They are often used in conjunction with JavaScript event handlers to make web applications interactive and user-friendly.

Common use cases for buttons include "Submit" buttons in forms, "Click to Continue" buttons in onboarding flows, and "Add to Cart" buttons in e-commerce websites. When users interact with a button, it can trigger functions, validate input, and provide feedback, enhancing the overall user experience.
## For Example
<Button />

 React useState Hook
---

The `useState` hook in React is used for managing state within functional components. It allows you to create and update state variables. It returns an array with two elements:

1. The current state value.
2. A function to update the state.

Here's an example of how to use the `useState` hook:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```



---
React useEffect Hook
---

The `useEffect` hook in React is used for handling side effects and executing code after the component has rendered. It takes two parameters:

1. A function that contains the code you want to run.
2. An optional array of dependencies.

Here's an example of how to use the `useEffect` hook:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch data or perform side effects
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((result) => setData(result));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array, runs once after the initial render

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {data.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```




---
 React Custom Hooks
---

Custom hooks in React are user-defined functions that encapsulate and share logic across multiple components. They often start with the word "use" and can utilize built-in hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.

Here's an example of creating a custom hook:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useFetchData(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(url)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((result) => {
        setData(result);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading };
}
