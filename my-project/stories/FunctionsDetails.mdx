### `signIn(email: string, password: string): Promise<void>`

The `signIn` function is responsible for authenticating a user with their email and password. It is an asynchronous function that takes two parameters: `email` and `password`.

#### Parameters
- `email` (string): The email address associated with the user's account.
- `password` (string): The user's password.

#### Returns
- A Promise that resolves with no specific value when the authentication process is completed.

#### Function Behavior
1. Sets the `isLoading` state to `true` to indicate that the authentication process is in progress.
2. Attempts to sign in the user by calling the `signInWithEmailAndPassword` function provided by Firebase Authentication.
3. If the sign-in operation is successful, it sets `isLoading` to `false`, indicating that the operation is complete.
4. If there is an error during the sign-in process, the function sets an error message using the `setError` function. The error message is set to "username or password may be wrong."
5. Finally, the function sets `isLoading` to `false` to conclude the authentication process.

#### Example
```javascript
try {
  // Attempt to sign in with email and password
  await signIn(email, password);
  // If successful, the user is now authenticated.
} catch (error) {
  // Handle any authentication errors here
  setError("username or password may be wrong");
}
```


### `signUp(email: string, password: string): Promise<void>`

The `signUp` function is responsible for registering a new user with their email and password. It is an asynchronous function that takes two parameters: `email` and `password`.

#### Parameters
- `email` (string): The email address the user wants to associate with their new account.
- `password` (string): The password chosen by the user for their new account.

#### Returns
- A Promise that resolves with no specific value when the user registration process is completed.

#### Function Behavior
1. Sets the `isLoading` state to `true` to indicate that the registration process is in progress.
2. Attempts to create a new user account by calling the `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` function provided by Firebase Authentication. This function creates a new user account using the provided email and password.
3. After creating the user account, the function sends an email verification request to the newly registered user by calling `sendEmailVerification(auth.currentUser)`. This email verification step is essential for confirming the user's identity.
4. Logs a message to the console indicating that the verification email has been sent.
5. If any errors occur during the registration process, they are caught, and the function logs the error and sets the `error` state to "Try Again."
6. Finally, the function sets `isLoading` to `false` to conclude the registration process.

#### Example
```javascript
try {
  // Attempt to create a new user account with email and password
  await signUp(email, password);
  // User account created and email verification sent.
} catch (error) {
  // Handle any registration errors here
  console.log("error", error);
  setError("Try Again");
}
```



### `logOut(): Promise<void>`

The `logOut` function is responsible for allowing a currently authenticated user to log out of their account. This function is asynchronous and doesn't require any parameters.

#### Returns
- A Promise that resolves with no specific value when the user logs out successfully.

#### Function Behavior
1. Sets the `isLoading` state to `true` to indicate that the log-out process is in progress.
2. Invokes the `signOut` function provided by Firebase Authentication to log the user out of their account.
3. After successfully signing out, the function calls `clearCart()` to clear the user's shopping cart or any relevant session data.
4. Sets the `isLoading` state to `false` to conclude the log-out process.

#### Example
```javascript
try {
  // Attempt to log the user out
  await logOut();
  // User successfully logged out.
} catch (error) {
  // Handle any log-out errors here
  console.error(error);
  setIsLoading(false);
}
```


    ### `changePassword(password: string): Promise<void>`

The `changePassword` function allows a user to change their password. It is asynchronous and requires the new password as a parameter.

#### Parameters
- `password` (string): The new password to set for the user's account.

#### Returns
- A Promise that resolves with no specific value when the password change is successful.

#### Function Behavior
1. Sets the `isLoading` state to `true` to indicate that the password change process is in progress.
2. Invokes the `updatePassword` function provided by Firebase Authentication to update the user's password to the new value.
3. After successfully changing the password, the function sets the `isLoading` state to `false` to conclude the process.

#### Example
```javascript
try {
  // Attempt to change the user's password
  const newPassword = "new-password123"; // Replace with the new password
  await changePassword(newPassword);
  // Password successfully changed.
} catch (error) {
  // Handle any password change errors here
  console.error(error);
  setIsLoading(false);
}
```

### `forgetPassword(email: string): Promise<void>`

The `forgetPassword` function allows a user to request a password reset for their account. It is asynchronous and requires the user's email address as a parameter.

#### Parameters
- `email` (string): The email address associated with the user's account.

#### Returns
- A Promise that resolves with no specific value after sending the password reset email.

#### Function Behavior
1. Checks if the `email` parameter is provided. If it's empty or undefined, it sets an error message using the `setError` function to inform the user to enter their email address and returns, effectively canceling the operation.

2. If the `email` is provided, the function attempts to send a password reset email using the `sendPasswordResetEmail` function provided by Firebase Authentication. This sends a password reset link to the user's email address.

3. Upon successful email delivery, it sets an informative message using the `setError` function to notify the user that the password reset link has been sent to their email.

4. If any errors occur during the process, they are caught and logged to the console, and an error message is set using `setError` to inform the user to try again.

#### Example
```javascript
try {
  // Attempt to send a password reset email
  const userEmail = "user@example.com"; // Replace with the user's email
  await forgetPassword(userEmail);
  // Password reset email sent successfully.
} catch (error) {
  // Handle any errors here
  console.error(error);
}
```
